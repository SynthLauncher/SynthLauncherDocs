 # Installing Optifine
 OptiFine is a mod used to enhance performance and use shaders.
 
 :::note
 OptiFine is more than a decade old, and since then; several 
 better alternatives for it have been becoming popular. It generally isn't recommended to use OptiFine in 2025 because it's been largely becoming obsolete. \
 We recommend using **Fabric + Sodium** for performance and **Fabric + Iris (+Sodium) **for shaders (and performance).
