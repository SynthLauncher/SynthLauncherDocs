 # Installing Optifine

:::note
It generally isn't recommended to use OptiFine in 2025 because it's been largely becoming replaced by better alternatives such as Sodium and Iris for performance-enhancing and shader capabilities.  \
We recommend using **Fabric + Sodium** for performance and **Fabric + Iris (+Sodium) **for shaders (and performance).
