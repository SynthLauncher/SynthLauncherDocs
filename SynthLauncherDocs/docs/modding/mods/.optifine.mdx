 # Installing Optifine
 OptiFine is a mod used to enhance performance and use shaders.
 
:::note
It generally isn't recommended to use OptiFine in 2025 because it's been largely becoming replaced by better alternatives such as Sodium and Iris for performance-enhancing and shader capabilities.  \
We recommend using **Fabric + Sodium** for performance and **Fabric + Iris (+Sodium) **for shaders (and performance).\
OptiFine also tends to cause **mod conflicts** which can prevent other mods from working alongside it.
