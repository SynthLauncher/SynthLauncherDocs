# Mod Loader FAQ

## What's a mod loader and why do I need it?
  You cannot modify much of the base version of Minecraft. It doesn't come with any built-in modding capabilities. This is why you need mod-loaders such as Fabric. 
  They are tools that allow you to install mods. You cannot load mods without them. 

  It doesn't really matter which one you use. Different mods, however, are designed 
  for different mod loaders. In the same way that Microsoft Paint won't run on macOS, a mod built for Fabric won't run on Forge as it's not built for that mod loader.

## What mod loader should I use?

  Usually the main two involved in this question are Forge and Fabric. 
  Fabric is generally used for QOL (quality-of-life) mods including performance mods, while Forge is usually used for 
  content mods. There's also Quilt and NeoForge, which are built opon Fabric and Forge respectively.

  At the moment, it's not recommended to use Quilt because it's fairly new and doesn't provide much advantages over Fabric (which is it based on) yet. In fact, you'd only actually 
  want to use it for the mods exclusive to it.
