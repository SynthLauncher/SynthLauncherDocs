## What is SynthLauncher?
SynthLauncher is a secure and open-source, Minecraft launcher with a sleek interface.\
The launcher is still ongoing development, but will feature;

- It provides support for offline accounts without the need for a Microsoft account, and has a much more modern UI, unlike Prism Launcher and MultiMC
- It provides the same offline account support, skins support, and modpack support of SKlauncher, but with added stability and much more frequent updates addressing bugs/issues
- It is frequently updated, unlike Legacy Launcher.
- It is less bloated, unlike the official Minecraft Launcher.

## Information

SynthLauncher was originally programmed in the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming language, but was rewritten in the [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) programming language.
